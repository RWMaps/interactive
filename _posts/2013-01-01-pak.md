##Displacement in north-west Pakistan

Pakistan's regions of Baluchistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (formerly known as North West Frontier Province) that border Afghanistan have suffered years of violence between militants and government security forces since 2008.  
In recent years, severe flooding has affected millions in Pakistan, and worsened the plight of those who had fled fighting.
